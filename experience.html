                <h4><b>BUILD A SYSTEM USING C++</b></h4>
                    <p>During my second semester, I learned about coding and was given an assignment to build a coding system using C++. This assignment was given individually and also in groups. This gave me new experiences and allowed me to learn new things.</p>

                    <h4><b>UNIFORMED UNIT CAMPING</b></h4> 
                    <p>I once participated in a uniform unit camp that took place at a military camp when I was 12 years old. There, I engaged in various tough activities and carried out bravery activities where we had to walk in the dark in the forest until we found our way out. We also practiced marching in the heat and bathed in mud.</p>

                    <p>When the holiday season arrives, I will work as a waiter at a food stall in my residential area. I work to take customer orders, pack food, wash dishes, and so on. This allows me to interact with many people and improve my social skills.</p>

                    <p> Upon graduating at the STPM level, I worked at a supermarket as a promoter. I was assigned to open and arrange all the clothing stock and serve customers. I was able to learn many new things while also overcoming my fear of heights because I had to climb a metal ladder every time I wanted to organize new clothes.</p>
