        Hi, my name is Noor Artiqah Syahirah binti Razali, and I am better known as Tiqah. 
        I am the youngest child of four siblings and the only one who is still continuing my studies. 
        I have had the ambition to become a teacher since I was little. However, that dream did not come true as I did not receive an offer in the field I desired.
        But I believe that everything that happens has a reason behind it. I have hobbies including drawing, coloring, and sports. 
        I really enjoy running because when I run, I feel like all my problems disappear for a moment.
        I also love to eat, especially spicy food and sweet treats like chocolate and ice cream.
        I am also a big fan of K-dramas and K-pop. I can finish one drama in a single night. 
        Among the K-pop idols I admire the most are BTS and Blackpink. This is because they have taught me the meaning of self-love through the lyrics of their songs.
        There are many things I like, and one of them is that I really love animals. My favorite animal is cats. 
        I enjoy feeding stray cats and petting them regardless of their appearance because I believe that all cats deserve the same love and affection. I also have pet cats at home named Miki, Mika, and Miko.
